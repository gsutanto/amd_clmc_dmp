In trajectory_tracking_failure folder:
While the idealistic (but non-realistic) DMP unrolling (light-green curve) successfully reproduced the correct behavior (dark-blue curve), the realistic DMP unrolling (cyan curve) fails to track the correct behavior. This is because there is no guarantee at all that the robot will exactly track/follow the same trajectory as the learning trajectory during unrolling/reproduction.
This was produced using the following parameters:
N_beta_grid		= 3
N_k_phi1_phi2_grid	= 5
N_k_phi3_grid		= 5
beta_low		= 3.0/M_PI
beta_high		= 5.0/M_PI
k_phi1_phi2_low		= 1.0
k_phi1_phi2_high	= 2.0
k_phi3_low		= 1.0
k_phi3_high		= 2.0

Turns out that this problem can be solved by simply widening the range of beta and k values.
See trajectory_tracking_success folder:
This time the tracking is successful in the realistic DMP unrolling, PROBABLY because of wider range of beta and k values.
This was produced using the following parameters:
N_beta_grid		= 3
N_k_phi1_phi2_grid	= 5
N_k_phi3_grid		= 5
beta_low		= 0.5/M_PI
beta_high		= 10.0/M_PI
k_phi1_phi2_low		= 0.1
k_phi1_phi2_high	= 10.0
k_phi3_low		= 0.1
k_phi3_high		= 10.0
