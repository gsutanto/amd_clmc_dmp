Execution Order for Reproducing Experimental Results in MATLAB:
**---------------- Learning Feedback/Coupling Term Model on TensorFlow and Its Verification ----------------**
 [1] Prepare the Training and Generalization Testing Dataset, by running the following scripts in amd_clmc_dmp/matlab/dmp_coupling/learn_obs_avoid/learn_obs_avoid_pmnn_vicon_data/:
     >> on MATLAB: convert_demo_to_supervised_obs_avoid_fb_dataset.m 
                   => tf_obs_avoid_data_preparation_robot_unroll.m
                   => [optional] subsample_test_unroll_dataset.m
 [2] Perform Feedback Model Training in TensorFlow in Python:
     >> on Spyder: amd_clmc_dmp/python/dmp_coupling/learn_obs_avoid/tf/learn_obs_avoid_feedback_w_PMNN.py
     (ensuring (is_performing_generalization_test == 0) on line 49 is selected...)
 [3] Using helper script amd_clmc_dmp/python/dmp_coupling/learn_obs_avoid/tf/models/compare_nmse_generalization_among_reinits.m ,
     inspect and compare among the prim_1_nmse_reinit_<y>_step_<TF_max_train_iters>.mat files for y in [0,1,2], 
     and manually select y which has the best (lowest) nmse_generalization_test.
     Suppose y_{best}=2;
     then write/update the file amd_clmc_dmp/python/dmp_coupling/learn_obs_avoid/tf/models/reinit_selection_idx.txt with content:
     "2" (without the double quotes when writing in the file of course...).
 [4] Execute the script amd_clmc_dmp/data/dmp_coupling/learn_obs_avoid/static_obs/update_obs_avoid_data_after_TF_training.m .
 [5] Test the trained Feedback Model performing prediction on unseen demonstration/trial in TensorFlow in Python:
     >> on Spyder: amd_clmc_dmp/python/dmp_coupling/learn_obs_avoid/tf/test_learned_obs_avoid_feedback_w_PMNN.py
 [6] Execute TensorFlow Python versus MATLAB prediction based on trained parameters, by running the following scripts in amd_clmc_dmp/matlab/dmp_coupling/learn_obs_avoid/learn_obs_avoid_pmnn_vicon_data/:
     >> on MATLAB: test_TensorFlow_trained_obs_avoid_fb_NN_model.m
**---------------- Unrolling Test of the Learned Feedback/Coupling Term Model: with Dynamics vs. without Dynamics ----------------**
 [7] Execute the unrolling test of the learned feedback/coupling term model, between with dynamics versus without dynamics, 
     by running the following scripts in amd_clmc_dmp/matlab/dmp_coupling/learn_obs_avoid/learn_obs_avoid_pmnn_vicon_data/:
     >> on MATLAB: test_unroll_learned_pmnn_obs_avoid_fb.m
 [8] Compare the NMSE between with-dynamics unrolling versus without-dynamics unrolling, 
     by running the following scripts in amd_clmc_dmp/matlab/dmp_coupling/learn_obs_avoid/learn_obs_avoid_pmnn_vicon_data/:
     >> on MATLAB: evaluate_NMSE_unroll.m
